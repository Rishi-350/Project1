🔧 Mini Project Highlight – Low Dropout Regulator (LDO) Design & Simulation 🔍

Successfully designed and simulated a Low Dropout (LDO) Voltage Regulator using PMOSFET architecture in both LTSpice and Proteus 8 Professional. The project focused on maintaining a stable output voltage across varying input levels with minimal dropout, ensuring efficient power regulation.
Captured results include simulation graphs, waveform analysis, and performance data like dropout voltage vs input variations.
This hands-on experience deepened my understanding of analog circuit design and practical power management.
